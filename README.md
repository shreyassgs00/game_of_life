This program is a bounded field Conway's game of life.

The program currently used 0's and 1's to display dead and alive cells respectively.

The user can specify the height and width of the bounded field by simply running main.py
and the program will generate the random patterns in accordance with the rules of Conway's game of life.
The initial state of the system is determined by generating pseudo-random ones which are replaced in the place
of zeroes already exisiting in the bounded state.

The unbounded version is still in progress.
